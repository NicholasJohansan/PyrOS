# PyrOS
PyrOS is a console-based operating system that hopefully can help you partially in certain things as well as for entertainment purposes.

It have become more easily distributable as well as using a database stored clientside, so every version will still save your account.

Currently, PyrOS has:

__Games__
- Hangman
- Guess the number
- Robot Warfare [TIRWS]

__Cipher__
- Playfair Cipher
- Caesar Cipher
- Country Cipher

__Calc__
- kinda useless evaluator of simple maths

Though, there are very few things in it, I will add on to it after I've finished my portfolio.

After all, there are actually many more modules that I already have as a standalone script, it is just a matter of time before I integrate it into the OS!
Disclaimer: I'm lazy

PyrOS - v0.1 Official release, available now!

PyrOS is generally very mature, it has went through different stages of my coding abilities/experience, so if you look at its source code, you might find varying levels of coding difficulties.

This have been around for a long time on my computer while I went and learn other things instead of staying with console-based scripts.
